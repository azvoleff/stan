This journal article provides a nice abridged summary of the Stan
probabilistic programming system. The history of Stan positions the
system as a successor to the BUGS/JAGS Bayesian inference systems.
This section makes clear that the primary contribution of Stan is not
being a compiled JAGS but more of a compiled Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
sampler. Stan is an impressive piece of software with many components.
This article covers all aspects of this complex system highlighting
the modeling language, the various inference engines supported, and
all the optimizations done on the backend to make the system
performant.

I have several nitpicks that I believe should be corrected before the
paper is published.

* The abstract should refer to Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno
algorithm as BFGS. That is how it is referred to in the rest of the
paper and should be stated as such.

* The example problem in section 2.1 should not be across page breaks.

* In Section 1 (RHMC) should be (RMHMC)

* Section 2 is called Overview but would more accurately be described
as an Example of the system

* Section 2 involves sampling an example model, diagnosing the
sampler, and then running an optimizer over the program. This
introduction of the optimizer seems like it should be introduced
before diagnosing the sampler.

* Section 3 is called Models but is largely about Modeling Language. A
more informative section title would help here.

* Unsure why the same model can't be used in Section 2 and Section 3

* Section 9 on Random Number Generation feels unnecessary as Stan does
not make use of anything novel here.
